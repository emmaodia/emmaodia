### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emmanuel! I'm known by colleagues and in Developer Circles as @emma_odia. A Software Engineer who started programming as a Teenager in 2009. This passion for writing software to build applications continued into University while studying Mathematics as an undergraduate.
